# Python in steps

This is a repository to get you from zero to comfortable with Python.
It is a work in progress, and largely focuses on helping you learn how to learn.

## How to run an example

Check out the repository, to do this you'll need `git` on your command line.

```
git clone https://github.com/AlexsJones/python_in_steps.git
```

This will create a directory called `python_in_steps` with all the files in it.

You can then run the examples by running the python interpreter and passing the file as an argument.

```
‚ùØ python examples/0/main.py
Hello,World!
```
